# Code Café – React Starter ⚛️☕

This starter is for exploring **React basics** in a low-pressure way.

React is an **optional path** in today’s session.  
If you’re new to web development, start with the HTML/CSS starter instead.

---

## What you’ll do today
Pick **one**:
- Run the React app
- Change what’s on the page
- Create a small component
- Add simple interactivity

You do NOT need to understand everything.

---

## Before you start

You need **Node.js (LTS)** installed.

Check if you already have it:
```bash
node -v
```
No node? Download it from https://nodejs.org/

## How to run the project

1. Install the dependencies (make sure you are in the root folder)
```
npm install
```
2. Start the app
```
npm run dev
```
You’ll see a local link (e.g. http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser.

The page will refresh automatically after every change.

---

## What to work on (task ideas)

- Change the main heading text
- Create a simple component (e.g. Card or Button)
- Render a component multiple times
- Add a button that updates the page

You do NOT need to understand everything.
Please use online resources and documentation!

If you get stuck, ask for help! That’s the point! ☕
